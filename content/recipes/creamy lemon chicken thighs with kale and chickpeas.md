## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 Tbsps - Avocado Or Olive Oil
- [ ] 1½ Lbs - Boneless Chicken Thighs
- [ ] 1 Tsp - Salt
- [ ] ½ Tsp - Black Pepper
- [ ] 1 Tsp - Smoked Paprika
- [ ] 15oz Can - Chickpeas, Rinsed
- [ ] 2 Cups - Chopped Kale Leaves
- [ ] 2 Tbsps - Ghee or Butter
- [ ] 15oz Can - Full-Fat Coconut Milk
- [ ] 3 Cloves - Garlic, Minced
- [ ] 1 Lemon - Zested, Juiced

## Directions

1. In a large pan, heat the avocado/olive oil over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, then season with salt, pepper and paprika, rubbing the spices all over.
2. Carefully place the chicken thighs on the pan and cook for 5-8 minutes, until browned and crispy on one side, then flip and cook for another 5-8 minutes. When the chicken is crisp on all sides, remove and set aside.
3. Add the rinsed chickpeas and chopped kale leaves to the same pan and sauté to a crisp, about 10-12 minutes. Season with additional spices if desired, then set aside.
4. Add the ghee to the same pan over medium heat and melt it. Add the minced garlic and cook until aromatic, then pour in the coconut milk, lemon juice and zest. Bring everything to a simmer.
5. Once the sauce is simmering, reduce heat to low and add back in the chicken by carefully placing each chicken thigh in the pan. Top everything with the chopped kale and chickpeas and cook for a few minutes on low to reheat.
6. Serve immediately for best results by plating the chicken and topping it with the lemon cream sauce and extra kale and chickpeas. Goes well with basmati rice! Store in the refrigerator for up to four days.
