## Ingredients

- [ ] ½ Tsp - Baking Soda
- [ ] 2 Tbsps - Butter (No Substitutes)
- [ ] 1¾ Cups - All-Purpose Flour
- [ ] ½ Tsp - Salt
- [ ] 2 - Eggs
- [ ] 8 Ounces - White Chocolate Baking Bar
- [ ] ½ Cup - Seedless Raspberry Jam
- [ ] ½ Tsp - Shortening
- [ ] 1 Cup - Sugar

## Directions

1. Chop half (4 ounces) of the white baking bar; set aside. Cut up the other half (4 ounces) of the white baking bar and melt in a heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly; cool.
2. Beat butter in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar, baking soda, and salt; beat until combined.
3. Beat in eggs and melted baking bar until combined. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Stir in any remaining flour with a wooden spoon. Stir in chopped white baking bar.
4. Drop dough from a rounded teaspoon 2 inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Bake in a 375°F (190°C) oven for 7-9 minutes or until cookies are slightly browned around the edges. Cool on cookie sheet for 1 minute. Remove cookies and cool on wire rack. Store in an airtight container or plastic bag at room temperature up to 3 days.
5. Just before serving, melt jam in a small saucepan over low heat. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of jam onto the top of each cookie. Melt the 3 ounces white baking bar and shortening in a heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Drizzle over cookies using a fork.
