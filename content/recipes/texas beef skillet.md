## Directions

1. In a large skillet, cook the ground beef and onions over medium heat until the beef is browned and the onions are tender. Drain any excess fat.
2. Add the canned tomatoes (with their juices), red kidney beans (drained and rinsed), instant rice, chopped green pepper, chili powder, and garlic salt to the skillet. Stir to combine.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the rice is tender and the flavors have melded together.
4. Remove the skillet from heat and sprinkle the shredded American cheese over the top of the beef mixture. Cover the skillet and let it sit for a few minutes, allowing the cheese to melt.
5. Serve the Texas Beef Skillet hot, garnished with crushed corn chips for added texture and flavor.
