- [ ] 1 Cup - Salted Butter
- [ ] 1 Cup - Granulated Sugar
- [ ] 2 Eggs
- [ ] 1 Tsp - Vanilla Extract
- [ ] ½ Tsp - Almond Extract
- [ ] 3 Cups - All-Purpose Flour
- [ ] 2 Tsps - Baking Powder

### Sweet Almond Icing

- [ ] ½ Cup - Salted Butter, softened
- [ ] 3 Cups - Powdered Sugar
- [ ] 1 Tsp - Almond Extract
- [ ] 1-3 Tbsps - Milk
- [ ] Food Coloring (optional)

## Directions

### Sugar Cookies

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the salted butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Beat until well mixed.
4. Scrape down the sides again and add the all-purpose flour and baking powder. Mix until the dough is thoroughly combined.
5. Scoop out about ¼ Cup of cookie dough and roll it into a ball. Repeat with the remaining dough.
6. Flatten each cookie dough ball by gently pressing the bottom of a drinking glass or measuring Cup onto the center of the dough. This will create a round, flattened shape.
7. Place the flattened dough onto baking sheets, leaving enough space between them as they will spread during baking. A maximum of 6 cookies per pan is recommended.
8. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 9-11 minutes, or until the centers have puffed up and are no longer glossy.
9. Once baked, allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets.

### Sweet Almond Icing

1. While the cookies are cooling, make the sweet almond icing.
2. In a mixing bowl, cream the softened butter until smooth.
3. Gradually add in the powdered sugar, almond extract, and milk. Mix until the icing is smooth and creamy. Adjust the milk amount for desired consistency.
4. If desired, add neon pink food coloring to achieve the desired color for the icing.

### Icing and Serving

1. While the cookies are still slightly warm, spread the sweet almond icing on top of each cookie. The warmth of the cookies will slightly melt the icing, creating a smooth and glossy finish.
2. Once the cookies have completely cooled, place them in the refrigerator to chill until ready to serve. These cookies are best enjoyed chilled.
