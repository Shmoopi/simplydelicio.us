## Instructions

### Marinade

1. In a bowl, combine the plain yogurt, lemon juice, turmeric powder, garam masala, chili powder (or cayenne pepper powder), ground cumin, grated ginger, and crushed garlic to create the marinade.
2. Add the chicken thigh fillets to the marinade, ensuring they are evenly coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the chicken in the marinade for at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours.

### Cooking

1. Heat the ghee (or butter/oil) over high heat in a large fry pan.
2. Take the marinated chicken out of the marinade, but do not wipe off or shake off the excess marinade from the chicken. Place the chicken in the fry pan and cook for about 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it won't brown much due to the marinade).
3. For the sauce, add the tomato passata, heavy cream, sugar, and salt to the pan. Also, add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down the heat to low and simmer the sauce for about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
4. If desired, garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves.
5. Serve the creamy Indian butter chicken over basmati rice.
