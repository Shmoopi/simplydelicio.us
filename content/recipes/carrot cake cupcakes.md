## Directions

### Cupcakes

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon, mixing well.
3. Add the vegetable oil, eggs, grated carrots, crushed pineapple (undrained), and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly combined.
4. Pour the batter into cupcake liners.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
6. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pans for a few minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Cream Cheese Frosting

1. In a large mixing bowl, prepare the cream cheese frosting. Beat together the confectioners' sugar, softened cream cheese, softened butter or margarine, and lemon extract until smooth.
2. Once the cakes are completely cooled, frost between the layers and on the top and sides with the cream cheese frosting.
3. Optional: Garnish with additional grated carrots or chopped nuts if desired.
4. Slice and serve this classic carrot cake with its rich and creamy cream cheese frosting.
