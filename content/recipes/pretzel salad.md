## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a bowl, mix the crushed pretzels, 3 Tbsps of sugar, and melted margarine until well combined.
3. Pat the pretzel mixture into a 9" x 13" pan and bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Allow it to cool completely.
4. In another bowl, mix the cream cheese, 1 Cup of sugar, and drained crushed pineapple until well combined.
5. Fold in the Cool Whip® to the cream cheese mixture, creating a creamy filling.
6. Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly over the cooled pretzel crust.
7. Dissolve the raspberry gelatin powder in the boiling water, stirring until fully dissolved.
8. Add the frozen raspberries to the gelatin mixture and stir until slightly thickened.
9. Spread the raspberry mixture on top of the Cool Whip® mixture.
10. Place the pan in the refrigerator and let it set until firm.
11. Once set, cut the pretzel salad into squares and serve chilled.
