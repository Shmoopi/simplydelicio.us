## Instructions

### Graham Cracker Crust

1. If you’re starting out with full graham crackers, use a food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. You can also place them in a zip-top bag and crush them into fine crumbs with a little arm muscle and a rolling pin.
2. Stir the graham cracker crumbs and granulated sugar together in a medium bowl, and then stir in the melted butter. The mixture will be thick, coarse, and sandy. Try to smash/break up any large chunks.
3. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 8-inch, 9-inch, or 10-inch pie dish, cake pan, springform pan, or square pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly. Tip: You can use a small flat-bottomed measuring Cup to help press down the bottom crust and smooth out the surface, but do not pack down too hard. If making a pie, run a spoon around the bottom “corner” where the edge and bottom meet to help make a rounded crust⁠—this helps prevent the crust from falling apart when you cut slices.
4. For a baked dessert, pre-bake this crust per your filling recipe’s directions. I usually pre-bake for 10 minutes at 350°F (177°C). For a no-bake dessert, cool the crust completely before using, unless your filling’s recipe instructs otherwise.

### Cream Cheese Filling

1. Place one 8-Oz package of the cream cheese, ⅓ Cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl.
2. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, then beat in the remaining 3 packages of the cream cheese.
3. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat in the remaining 1 and ⅓ Cups of the sugar, then beat in the vanilla.
4. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating the batter well after each one.
5. Blend in heavy cream.
6. At this point mix the filling only until completely blended (just like they do at Junior's). Be careful not to overmix the batter.
7. Gently spoon the cheese filling on top of the baked sponge cake layer.
8. Place the springform pan in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the side of the pan.
9. Bake the cheesecake until the center barely jiggles when you shake the pan, about 1 hour.
10. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 1 hour.
11. Then cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until it's completely cold, at least 4 hours or overnight.
12. Remove the sides of the springform pan.
13. Enjoy!
15. Store any leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator.
