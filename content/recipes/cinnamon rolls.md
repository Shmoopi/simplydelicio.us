## Directions

### Cinnamon Rolls

1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in ¼ Cup of warm water with 1 Tsp of sugar (per package of yeast). Let it stand for 10 minutes or until it becomes bubbly.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the salt, sugar, and flour.
3. Next, add the beaten egg, oil, and water.
4. Add the yeast mixture to the bowl and mix well.
5. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
6. Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for 2 hours.
7. After 2 hours, punch down the dough, knead it again, and let it rise for an additional 2 hours.
8. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a rectangle shape ~ 12" x 6".
9. Spread the softened butter or margarine over the surface of the dough.
10. Cover with a layer of brown sugar and sprinkle with cinnamon.
11. Roll up starting on the long side of the dough.
12. Cut into ~ ½" slices using a knife, thread, or floss.
13. Place the cinnamon rolls on greased baking pans.
14. Allow the cinnamon rolls to stand overnight, or until they double in size.
15. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
16. Bake the cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven for about 12 to 15 minutes or until they are golden brown and cooked through.

### Icing

1. In a large mixing bowl or stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and heavy cream on low until smooth.
2. Spread with a knife or spoon over the top of the cinnamon rolls.
