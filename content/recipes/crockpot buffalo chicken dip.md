## Directions

1. Throw it all in a crockpot for 3-4 hours on high, or 6-8 hours on low, until the chicken is soft and easy to shred.
2. Using two forks, shred the chicken in the crockpot, or remove the chicken and use a cutting board or stand mixer.
3. Serve immediately with chips, veggies, or pita bread. Keep on warm while serving.
