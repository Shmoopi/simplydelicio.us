## Directions

1. Combine the lukewarm water, honey, and yeast in a bowl, stir and set aside.
2. Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl.
3. Add in the water/honey/wheat mixture and olive oil to the mixing bowl. (Add additional herbs if desired)
4. Combine until a dough forms.
5. Knead with a bread-hook attachment or by hand for about 5 minutes.
6. Let rise for 1 hour.
7. Punch down the dough and then shape it into the desired shape by hand.
8. Place on a pizza stone or loaf pan dusted with semolina flour (regular flour works, too).
9. Let rise another 20 minutes while the oven preheats to 350°F (180°C).
10. Depending on the pan and the thickness of the loaf, bake for about 35 minutes until golden brown.
