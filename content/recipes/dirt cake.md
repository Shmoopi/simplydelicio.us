## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the cream cheese, margarine, instant vanilla pudding, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined.
2. Fold in the Cool Whip® until incorporated.
3. Crush the Oreo cookies into small crumbs. You can use a food processor or place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin.
4. In a separate container or serving dish, layer the pudding mixture with the cookie crumbs, starting with a layer of pudding mix and ending with a layer of 1-inch cookie crumbs on top.
5. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cookie crumbs on top.
6. Garnish the dirt cake with gummy worms and flowers to resemble a potted plant.
7. Refrigerate the dirt cake for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together and for the dessert to set.
8. Serve chilled and enjoy this fun and delicious dirt cake!

Note: For an extra touch, you can layer the dirt cake in a clay flower pot to enhance the potted plant presentation.
