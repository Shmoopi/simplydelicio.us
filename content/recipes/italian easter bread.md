## Instructions

1. Mix together the yeast, milk, salt, butter, eggs, and sugar in a large bowl. Add 2 cups of flour and beat until smooth, using the paddle attachment on low speed. Gradually add the rest of the flour until a dough forms.
2. Switch to the dough hook attachment and knead on low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour if needed until tacky, not sticky. Alternatively, knead the dough on a floured surface by hand.
3. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turning once to coat both sides. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, about 1 hour.
4. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone liner. Punch down the dough and divide into 12 equal pieces (about 3.5 Ounces each). Roll each piece into a 14-inch rope.
5. Twist two ropes together to form a braid, then join the ends to loop into a circle, pinching the tips together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough ropes. Cover with a clean towel and let rise again until nearly doubled, about 1 more hour.
6. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the tops of the dough "nests" with egg wash, then top evenly with sprinkles.
7. Place one egg in the center of each nest, pressing down lightly to secure. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
