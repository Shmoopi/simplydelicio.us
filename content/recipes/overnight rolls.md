## Directions

1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in ¼ Cup of warm water with 1 Tsp of sugar (per packet of yeast). Let it stand for 10 minutes or until it becomes bubbly.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the salt, sugar, and flour.
3. Next, add the beaten egg, oil, and water.
4. Add the yeast mixture to the bowl and mix well.
5. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
6. Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for 2 hours.
7. After 2 hours, punch down the dough, knead it again, and let it rise for an additional 2 hours.
8. Shape the dough into rolls and place them on greased baking pans.
9. Allow the rolls to stand overnight, or until they double in size.
10. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
11. Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for about 12 to 15 minutes or until they are golden brown and cooked through.
12. If you prefer making bread, shape the dough into a loaf and bake it for 20 to 25 minutes or until the bread is nicely browned.
