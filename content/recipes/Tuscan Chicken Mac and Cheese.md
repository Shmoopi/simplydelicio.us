## Directions

### Preperation

1. Pound down chicken breast to an inch thick, or cut in half making 4 even sized breasts.  If using chicken thighs, clean and lay them out.
2. Using a paper towel, pat dry the chicken.
3. Lightly coat the chicken with olive oil and add the spices to your liking.  More salt will give the chicken a crispier outside.
4. Dice yellow onion and set aside in a bowl.
5. Crush, peel, and finely chop garlic and set aside.
6. Drain the sun dried tomatoes, keeping about 2 Tbsps of the oil from the jar, discarding the rest.
7. Chop the sun dried tomatoes to your liking.
8. Shred the cheeses and set aside in a bowl.  Using blocks of cheese and shredding them yourself will give the best results, as pre-shredded cheeses using an anti-caking agent and may cause the end result to be gritty or less creamy.

### Cooking

1. Heat a large pot on medium on stovetop.
2. When hot, add olive oil and swirl around the pot to coat the bottom.
3. Place the chicken in the pan and cook until golden brown on the outside and cooked fully on the inside.
4. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.
5. In the same pot; add the butter and diced onion and cook until the onion starts getting translucent.
6. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.
7. Pour in the white wine and allow to simmer for five minutes, or until it begins to reduce down.
8. Add the sun dried tomatoes and the preserved oil.  Cook for 1-2 minutes.
9. Mix in the flour and allow to cook for another minute.
10. Add in the chicken broth, 2.5 Cups of light cream (or milk), italian herbs, salt, and pepper, and bring to a low simmer.
11. Add the macaroni to the pot and stir occasionally.  Let it cook until the macaroni is al dente.
12. Wash off the spinach and add to the pot when the macaroni is done cooking, stirring until it is wilted.
13. Remove the pot from the heat and add the cheese in quickly.  Stir until all of the cheese is melted in, adding in salt and pepper to taste.
14. Add in the remaining cream, in increments, to get to your desired consistency.  Keep in mind that it will continue to thicken as it cools.
15. Slice the cooked chicken into strips and mix into the pasta, adding any juices leftover on the plate.
16. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
