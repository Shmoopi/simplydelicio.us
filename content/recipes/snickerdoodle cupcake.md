## Directions

### Cookies

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C)
2. Add the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar to a stand mixer. Mix for 2-3 minutes.
3. Add the eggs and vanilla, then mix again.
4. Add the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined.
5. Combine the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl.
6. For GIANT sized cookies, scoop ½ Cup of dough and roll into a large ball.
7. Drop the dough into the bowl with cinnamon and sugar and roll to coat the entire ball.
8. Add up to 6 cookies on a normal sized cookie sheet. Flatten the dough balls slightly using a cup to about ½ inch thick.
9. Bake for 18-21 minutes. Cookies should look just set, the center may rise slightly, and they may still appear slightly doughy. This is perfect.
10. Let the cookies cool before icing.

### Icing

1. Combine butter and cream cheese in a stand mixer and mix for 2 minutes.
2. Add powdered sugar and vanilla and mix another two minutes.
3. Pipe frosting onto each cookie and dust with extra cinnamon sugar.
