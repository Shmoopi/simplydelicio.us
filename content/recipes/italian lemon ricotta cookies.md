## Directions

1. In a large bowl blend your softened butter and sugar until it becomes creamy
2. Add egg, ricotta and vanilla extract. Blend until combined
3. In a smaller bowl combine your dry ingredients
4. Slowly combine your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients. Blend for a few minutes until it becomes a thick dough (it should resemble the texture of play doh) - note: if for some reason your texture is more runny no matter how long your texture is more runny no matter how long you blend it.. try adding a touch more flour
5. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour
6. Meanwhile combine the ingredients for your glaze. (Keep in the fridge until cookies are cooled)
7. Once your dough has chilled, use an ice cream scoop and roll into balls
8. Bake at 350 for about 14-16 minutes (keep a close eye at the bottom of the cookies —the top will still look raw; however once the bottom is a golden brown remove from oven)
9. Remove and let completely cool
10. Dip the top of your cookie into your glaze and finish off with some sprinkles (glaze should drip down the sides of your cookie)
