## Directions

1. Add the olive oil to a large soup pot and place it over medium-high heat for two minutes. Add the diced onion. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Add the ground beef to the pot. Break it apart with a wooden spoon. Cook for 6-7 minutes until the beef is browned, stirring occasionally.
3. Add the chili powder, ground cumin, sugar, tomato paste, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and optional cayenne. Stir until well combined.
4. Add the beef broth, diced tomatoes (with their juice), drained kidney beans, and tomato sauce. Stir well.
5. Bring the liquid to a low boil. Then, reduce the heat (low to medium-low) to gently simmer the chili, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Remove the pot from the heat. Let the chili rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.
7. Serve this hearty beef chili on its own or with your favorite toppings such as shredded cheese, sour cream, or chopped green onions.

### Optional

1. When chili is nearing completion, bring another large pot with water to boil.
2. Add macaroni noodles and cook.
3. Drain noodles, but save a small amount of pasta water to add to chili.
4. Add a small amount of butter to keep the pasta from getting sticky.
