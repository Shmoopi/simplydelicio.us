## Directions

1. In a small sauce pot, melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Add the sugar and vanilla extract to the pot and stir until melted and well combined.
3. Stir in the mashed bananas and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is heated through and the bananas are well incorporated.
4. Taste the syrup and add additional sugar if desired, adjusting the sweetness to your preference.
5. Remove the pot from heat and let the syrup cool slightly.
6. Serve the banana syrup warm over pancakes, waffles, or any other desired desserts.
7. Store any leftover syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.
