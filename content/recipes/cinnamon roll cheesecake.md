## Instructions

### Crust

1. Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line a 9-inch (23cm) springform pan with parchment paper in the bottom and grease the sides.
2. Combine the crust ingredients in a small bowl. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the springform pan.
3. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool.
4. Cover the outsides of the pan with aluminum foil so that water from the water bath cannot get in. Set prepared pan aside.

### Cheesecake and Cinnamon Filling

1. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F (148°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, and flour on low speed until completely combined and smooth.
3. Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Beat on low speed until well combined.
4. Add eggs one at a time, mixing slowly after each addition until well combined.
5. In another bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour for the cinnamon filling. Stir in melted butter until well combined.
6. Sprinkle about ¼ of the cinnamon filling over the crust, then spread about ⅓ of the cheesecake filling over it. Repeat layering the cinnamon filling and cheesecake filling two more times.
7. Sprinkle remaining cinnamon filling over top of cheesecake.
8. Place the springform pan inside another larger pan. Fill the outside pan with enough warm water to go about halfway up the sides of the springform pan.
9. Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes until the center is set but still jiggly.
10. Turn off the oven and leave the door closed for 30 minutes, then crack the door of the oven for another 30 minutes.
11. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and water bath, then let it cool to room temperature before refrigerating for 4-5 hours or overnight.

### Frosting

1. To make the frosting, mix cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy.
2. Add vanilla extract and powdered sugar and mix until well combined. Add heavy cream as needed until desired consistency is reached.
3. Remove cheesecake from the springform pan and pipe the frosting in a spiral design over the top.
4. Store the cheesecake in the fridge until ready to serve. Best if eaten within 4-5 days.
