## Directions

1. Generously grease a large jelly roll pan and line it with wax paper, then grease the paper as well. Sift powdered sugar onto a dish towel that is as big as the pan.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).
3. Beat eggs for 5 minutes. Gradually beat in sugar. Stir in pumpkin and lemon juice.
4. Sift together dry ingredients and stir into pumpkin mixture. Spread batter evenly into greased and lined pan. Bake for about 15 minutes at 350°F. Do not overbake.
5. Turn onto the dish towel immediately after removing from the oven. Roll from the small end, cake and towel together. Let cool completely.
6. Beat together powdered sugar, cream cheese, butter, and vanilla until smooth. Add more powdered sugar if a thicker filling is desired.
7. When cooled, carefully unroll, spread with cream cheese filling, and preroll. Refrigerate. Keeps for several days in the refrigerator and freezes well.
