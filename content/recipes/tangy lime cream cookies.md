## Directions

### Filing

1. Combine all filling ingredients except food color in 2-quart saucepan, mix well. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until mixture just comes to a boil and begins to thicken. Add food coloring as desired for green coloring.
2. Remove from heat. Set aside to cool.

### Cookies

1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Combine butter, sugar, egg yolk, and vanilla in large mixer bowl. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until well mixed. Reduce speed to low. Add flour and salt; beat until well mixed.
2. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place 1 inch apart onto greased cookie sheets. Make indentation in center of each cookie. Spoon about ½ Tsp filling into each cookie indentation.
3. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until set but not brown. Cool completely.
4. Sprinkle tops with powdered sugar if desired.
