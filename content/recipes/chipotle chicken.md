## Instructions

### Marinade

1. In a food processor or blender, combine the red onion, garlic, adobo sauce, ancho chile powder, olive oil, ground cumin, dried oregano, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Blend until smooth.
2. Pour the blended marinade into a measuring cup and add water to reach 1 Cup.
3. Place the boneless, skinless chicken in a large freezer-safe plastic bag. Pour the marinade into the bag, close it, and gently massage the marinade into the chicken until it's evenly coated. Place the bag in a dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.

### Stove Method

1. Heat 2 Tbsps of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
2. Add the marinated chicken to the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) on a meat thermometer. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to cook the chicken in batches.
3. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest on a cutting board for about 10 minutes. Tent with foil.
4. Chop the cooked chicken into small pieces, season with additional salt to taste, and serve on tortillas or in bowls with your preferred toppings.

### Grill Method

1. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Coat the grilling surface with 2 Tbsps of oil.
2. Grill the marinated chicken in batches, turning occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) on a meat thermometer. During grilling, you should notice bits of caramelized fond clinging to the outside of the chicken, adding to the flavor.
3. As you grill in batches, you can add 1-2 Tbsps of oil to the grilling surface.
4. Once grilled, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest on a cutting board for about 10 minutes. Tent with foil.
5. Chop the grilled chicken into small pieces, season with additional salt to taste, and serve on tortillas or in bowls with your desired toppings.
