### Pie Filling

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, flour, and ground cinnamon.
3. Add the peeled, cored, and sliced apples to the bowl and toss them with the sugar mixture until well coated.

### Pie Crust

1. In a mixing bowl, stir together flour and salt. Cut in shortening or lard until pieces are the size of small peas.
2. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp of the water over part of the mixture, gently toss with a fork. Push to side of bowl. Repeat till all is moistened.
3. Form dough into a ball.
4. On a lightly floured surface, flatten dough with hands.
5. Roll dough from center to edges, forming a circle about 12 inches in diameter.
6. Wrap pastry around rolling pin. Unroll onto a 9 inch pie plate.
7. Ease pastry into pie plate, being careful not to stretch pastry.
8. Trim to ½ inch beyond edge of pie plate, fold under extra pastry.
9. Make a fluted, rope-shape, or scalloped edge.

### Crumble Topping

1. Spoon the apple mixture into the pie crust, spreading it evenly.
2. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and butter. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix the ingredients until they resemble coarse crumbs.
3. Sprinkle the crumb mixture over the apples, covering the entire surface.
4. Place the pie dish on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown. If pie browns too quickly, cover edge with foil.
5. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before serving.
6. Serve the apple crumb pie warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!
