## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 Cups - All-Purpose Flour
- [ ] ½ Cup - Cold Butter (1 stick)
- [ ] 1½ Tsps - Salt
- [ ] 1 Tbsp - Sugar
- [ ] ½ Tsp - Baking Soda
- [ ] 1½ Tsps - Baking Powder
- [ ] ½ Cup - Milk
- [ ] ½ Cup - Buttermilk
- [ ] Melted Butter (for brushing on top of baked biscuits)

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200°C) and grease a cookie sheet or baking pan.
2. In a medium-sized or large bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, salt, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder to create your dry mixture.
3. Slice the cold butter into small pieces and add them to the bowl of dry ingredients.
4. Use a pastry cutter, pastry blender, or knife to cut the cold butter into small pea-sized pieces, incorporating it into the dry mixture.
5. Gently stir in the milk and buttermilk until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky.
6. Flour your cutting surface generously to prevent sticking. Roll out the dough and fold it three times to create layers. Roll it again until it's about ½-inch thick. Do not make the dough thicker than two inches to ensure the biscuits rise properly in the oven.
7. Sprinkle a bit of flour on top of the dough to minimize stickiness while cutting the biscuits.
8. Use a 2.5-inch or 3-inch biscuit cutter or a round glass of similar size to cut out biscuits. Avoid twisting the cutter; gently shake it to release the biscuit dough.
9. Arrange the cut biscuits closely together on the greased cookie sheet or baking pan, allowing them little room to widen. This will result in thick and fluffy biscuits.
10. Bake the biscuits for 20-24 minutes until the tops are light brown.
11. While the biscuits are baking, melt some butter to brush on top of the baked biscuits.
12. Once the biscuits are baked, remove them from the oven. Using a bakery brush, generously brush the tops of the golden-brown biscuits with melted butter.
