## Directions

### Cookies

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
4. Stir in the vanilla extract and anise oil.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
6. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until well combined and the dough comes together.
7. Form dough into a ball.
8. On a lightly floured surface, flatten dough and roll dough with a rolling pin from center to edges, forming a circle.
9. Use cookie cutters to shape them into desired cookie shapes.
10. Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between them.
11. Bake in the preheated oven for about 7-8 minutes, or until the edges turn golden brown.
12. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
13. Once cooled, store the cookies in an airtight container to maintain their freshness.

### Icing

1. Stir together the sugar, 3 Tbsps milk, corn syrup, and vanilla in a medium-sized bowl until combined.
2. If the icing is too thick, add the remaining milk, until the icing is thick but spreadable. If it's too thin, add a little more powdered sugar until the desired texture is reached. If you drizzle a little of the icing, it will hold for a few seconds before dripping. That is when you know it’s the right consistency and is ready to use.
3. If coloring the icing with different colors, divide into bowls and color as desired at this point.
4. Pipe or spread icing onto cookies and decorate, as desired.
