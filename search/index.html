In a medium-sized or large bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, salt, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder to create your dry mixture. Slice the cold butter into small pieces and add them to the bowl of dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter, pastry blender, or knife to cut the cold butter into small pea-sized pieces, incorporating it into the dry mixture. Gently stir in the milk and buttermilk until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky. Flour your cutting surface generously to prevent sticking. Roll out the dough and fold it three times to create layers. Roll it again until it&rsquo;s about 1/2-inch thick. Do not make the dough thicker than two inches to ensure the biscuits rise properly in the oven. Sprinkle a bit of flour on top of the dough to minimize stickiness while cutting the biscuits. Use a 2.5-inch or 3-inch biscuit cutter or a round glass of similar size to cut out biscuits. Avoid twisting the cutter; gently shake it to release the biscuit dough. Arrange the cut biscuits closely together on the greased cookie sheet or baking pan, allowing them little room to widen. This will result in thick and fluffy biscuits. Bake the biscuits for 20-24 minutes until the tops are light brown. While the biscuits are baking, melt some butter to brush on top of the baked biscuits. Once the biscuits are baked, remove them from the oven. Using a bakery brush, generously brush the tops of the golden-brown biscuits with melted butter.

Add the marinated chicken to the skillet and cook, turning occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) on a meat thermometer. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to cook the chicken in batches. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest on a cutting board for about 10 minutes. Tent with foil. Chop the cooked chicken into small pieces, season with additional salt to taste, and serve on tortillas or in bowls with your preferred toppings. Grill Method Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Coat the grilling surface with 2 tablespoons of oil. Grill the marinated chicken in batches, turning occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) on a meat thermometer. During grilling, you should notice bits of caramelized fond clinging to the outside of the chicken, adding to the flavor. As you grill in batches, you can add 1-2 tablespoons of oil to the grilling surface. Once grilled, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest on a cutting board for about 10 minutes. Tent with foil. Chop the grilled chicken into small pieces, season with additional salt to taste, and serve on tortillas or in bowls with your desired toppings. `,summary:"Delicious and flavorful spicy chicken made with a smoky marinade",time:"1h 15m",output:"8-10 servings",featured_image:"/chipotle-chicken.png",url:"https://simplydelicio.us/recipes/chipotle-chicken/"},"https://simplydelicio.us/recipes/crockpot-breakfast-casserole/":{title:"Crock Pot Breakfast Casserole",tags:["breakfast","casserole","eggs","cheese","sausage"],tags2:" breakfast,  casserole,  eggs,  cheese,  sausage, ",content:"Ingredients 30 Ounces - Frozen Shredded Hash Browns (e.g., Ore-Ida) 1 Pound - Breakfast Sausage, browned and drained (e.g., Jimmy Dean) 8 Ounces - Shredded Cheddar Cheese 8 Ounces - Shredded Mozzarella Cheese 3 - Green Onions, sliced 12 Large Eggs ½ Cup - Milk (any kind) ½ Tsp - Salt ¼ Tsp - Pepper Directions Spray a 6-quart crock pot with nonstick spray.
