You can also place them in a zip-top bag and crush them into fine crumbs with a little arm muscle and a rolling pin. Stir the graham cracker crumbs and granulated sugar together in a medium bowl, and then stir in the melted butter. The mixture will be thick, coarse, and sandy. Try to smash/break up any large chunks. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 8-inch, 9-inch, or 10-inch pie dish, cake pan, springform pan, or square pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly. Tip: You can use a small flat-bottomed measuring Cup to help press down the bottom crust and smooth out the surface, but do not pack down too hard. If making a pie, run a spoon around the bottom “corner” where the edge and bottom meet to help make a rounded crust⁠—this helps prevent the crust from falling apart when you cut slices. For a baked dessert, pre-bake this crust per your filling recipe’s directions. I usually pre-bake for 10 minutes at 350°F (177°C). For a no-bake dessert, cool the crust completely before using, unless your filling’s recipe instructs otherwise. Cream Cheese Filling Place one 8-Oz package of the cream cheese, ⅓ Cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, then beat in the remaining 3 packages of the cream cheese. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat in the remaining 1 and ⅓ Cups of the sugar, then beat in the vanilla. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating the batter well after each one. Blend in heavy cream. At this point mix the filling only until completely blended (just like they do at Junior&rsquo;s). Be careful not to overmix the batter. Gently spoon the cheese filling on top of the baked sponge cake layer. Place the springform pan in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the side of the pan. Bake the cheesecake until the center barely jiggles when you shake the pan, about 1 hour. Cool the cake on a wire rack for 1 hour. Then cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate until it&rsquo;s completely cold, at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove the sides of the springform pan. Enjoy! Store any leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator.

Add the brown sugar and mix until well creamed together, about 1 minute. Add the molasses and mix until combined. Add the dry ingredients, and mix until a dough forms. Add 1-2 tsp of milk if your dough is a bit crumbly. Roll and Chill: Divide the dough into two halves, and roll each one out to ⅜&quot; thickness between sheets of parchment paper. (Use a ruler to check this, or just eyeball halfway between ¼ and ½ inch. This is the perfect thickness for these cookies – trust! Even ½&quot; is perfect – but don&rsquo;t go lower than ⅜&quot;) Place the rolled dough, still sandwiched in parchment paper, on a baking sheet and cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel. Chill for 1-2 hours in the fridge or shorter in the freezer, until completely chilled and firm. Cut Out Cookies Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Cut shapes out of the chilled dough and place cookies a couple of inches apart on your prepared baking sheet. If the cookies are no longer firm and cold to the touch from working with the dough, pop the pan back in the fridge or freezer for 5 to 15 minutes to re-chill so that the cookies hold their shape when baked (it&rsquo;s fine to bake them from frozen). While the cookies are baking, combine your dough scraps, roll back out, and cut out more cookies. Repeat this until all remaining dough is gone! You will need to chill the dough for a bit again once you roll the scraps back out so that it&rsquo;s firm enough to cut the shapes easily. (Roll it back out between the parchment each time to keep things easy.) Bake Bake cookies for 8-9 minutes. The cookies should appear just set, and will look a tad puffy. The centers may look a tad underdone. Don&rsquo;t be tempted to over bake them! They will set up to the perfect soft baked cookies. Let them cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.
Tip: Bake a single test cookie first if you’re worried you’ll underbake them – you’ll see that 8 minutes yields the perfect cookie!
Decorate Decorate by dipping the cooled cookies in this glaze (swap the maple syrup for milk, if desired), dusting them with powdered sugar, or piping them with royal icing.
Make Royal Icing Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, starting with 4 Tbsps of water, and mix on high speed with an electric mixer for about 1 and ½ minutes. When the icing is the right consistency, you should be able to drizzle some of it into the bowl, and watch it sit on the surface of the mixture for 5-10 seconds before melting back in. If it&rsquo;s too thick, add 1 Tbsp of water at a time. If it&rsquo;s too thin, beat it for another 30 seconds to a minute, or add a bit more powdered sugar, a little at a time, beating between each addition. Add the royal icing to a piping bag fitted with a Wilton #1 or #2 tip and pipe desired designs. You can even use gel food coloring to tint the royal icing. `,summary:"Extremely soft and gingery gingerbread cookies with royal icing",time:"2h 30m",output:"3 dozen cookies",featured_image:"/gingerbread-cookies.png",url:"https://simplydelicio.us/recipes/gingerbread-cookies/"},"https://simplydelicio.us/recipes/shepherds-pie/":{title:"Shepherd's Pie",tags:["shepherd's pie","ground beef","potatoes","comfort food","baking"],tags2:" shepherd's pie,  ground beef,  potatoes,  comfort food,  baking, ",content:"Ingredients Meat Filling 2 Tbsps - Olive Oil 1 Cup - Chopped Yellow Onion 1lb - 90% Lean Ground Beef (or Ground Lamb) 2 Tsps - Dried Parsley Leaves 1 Tsp - Dried Rosemary Leaves 1 Tsp - Dried Thyme Leaves ½ Tsp - Salt ½ Tsp - Ground Black Pepper 1 Tbsp - Worcestershire Sauce 2 - Garlic Cloves, minced 2 Tbsps - All-Purpose Flour 2 Tbsps - Tomato Paste 1 Cup - Beef Broth 1 Cup - Frozen Mixed Peas &amp; Carrots ½ Cup - Frozen Corn Kernels Potato Topping 1½ - 2lb - Russet Potatoes (about 2 large potatoes), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 8 Tbsps - Unsalted Butter (1 stick) ⅓ Cup - Half &amp; Half ½ Tsp - Garlic Powder ½ Tsp - Salt ¼ Tsp - Ground Black Pepper ¼ Cup - Parmesan Cheese Instructions Make the Meat Filling Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes.

In a medium-sized or large bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, salt, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder to create your dry mixture. Slice the cold butter into small pieces and add them to the bowl of dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter, pastry blender, or knife to cut the cold butter into small pea-sized pieces, incorporating it into the dry mixture. Gently stir in the milk and buttermilk until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky. Flour your cutting surface generously to prevent sticking. Roll out the dough and fold it three times to create layers. Roll it again until it&rsquo;s about ½-inch thick. Do not make the dough thicker than two inches to ensure the biscuits rise properly in the oven. Sprinkle a bit of flour on top of the dough to minimize stickiness while cutting the biscuits. Use a 2.5-inch or 3-inch biscuit cutter or a round glass of similar size to cut out biscuits. Avoid twisting the cutter; gently shake it to release the biscuit dough. Arrange the cut biscuits closely together on the greased cookie sheet or baking pan, allowing them little room to widen. This will result in thick and fluffy biscuits. Bake the biscuits for 20-24 minutes until the tops are light brown. While the biscuits are baking, melt some butter to brush on top of the baked biscuits. Once the biscuits are baked, remove them from the oven. Using a bakery brush, generously brush the tops of the golden-brown biscuits with melted butter.

Grill the marinated chicken in batches, turning occasionally, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) on a meat thermometer. During grilling, you should notice bits of caramelized fond clinging to the outside of the chicken, adding to the flavor.
